# UViip-smallBFImager
## University of Victoria ionospheric imaging project's small beamformer imager

This contains the code that made up [Nicholas Bruce's MASc thesis](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/10704). An experiment was run at DRAO to use their prototype small beamformer to capture ionospheric images.

A [first proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pfbdfcbztzgd) to do the work was submitted in November of 2017 and can be accessed by contacting Nicholas Bruce.

A [second, successful proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bwnmrgjrvkqb) was written in March of 2018 and can be accessed by contacting Nicholas Bruce.

A [summary report](./docs/UViipReport_Harrison.pdf) was written after the experiment.

The research and successful thesis completion resulted in a paper being submitted to the PACRIM conference in August 2019.
